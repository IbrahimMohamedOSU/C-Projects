Instructions:
1) run 'make' in the lab5 directory to compile the code.
2) Then run './shell' to run the code.
3) After executing one or more commands, run Control+C to bring up
command history.
4) During the execution of the program or after its exit, all of the 
command history for that run will be present in the 'mohamed511.history' file.
5) To terminate the process, use Control+\ or Control+Z since Control+C will 
only bring up the command history.
